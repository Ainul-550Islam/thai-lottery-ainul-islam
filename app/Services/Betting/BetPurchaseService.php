/**
 * The one public entry point for buying a bet.
 *
 * Everything else in Phase 4.3 is reachable only through here. A caller needs no
 * knowledge of wallets, ledgers, locks, risk counters or tickets: it hands over a
 * request and receives either a result or a refusal, and in the refusal case the
 * database is unchanged.
 *
 * THE PIPELINE
 *   request -> forbidden client fields stripped -> exact-arithmetic check ->
 *   idempotency schema check -> replay check -> validation (draw, market, number,
 *   stake, multiplier, payout, risk preview) -> ATOMIC TRANSACTION (wallet lock ->
 *   idempotency recheck -> balance -> risk reservation -> bet -> item -> ticket ->
 *   debit -> ledger verification -> promotion) -> commit
 *
 * WHY THE REPLAY CHECK HAPPENS BOTH BEFORE AND INSIDE THE TRANSACTION
 * Before, because a retry of an already-completed purchase should cost nothing: it does
 * no validation, takes no lock and reads no risk counter, it just returns what was
 * bought. Inside, because the outer check is unlocked and a concurrent identical request
 * may commit in between. And underneath both, the UNIQUE constraint on
 * bets.idempotency_key is the actual guarantee - a database constraint, not a cache
 * entry and not an in-memory flag. A cache-based scheme would fail exactly when it
 * matters most: a cache miss, a cache flush or a second application server would each
 * let the same request debit the player twice.
 *
 * WHAT "IDEMPOTENT" MEANS HERE, PRECISELY
 * Same player, same draw, same client key => the same purchase. The second request
 * creates no bet, no item, no ticket, no financial transaction and no ledger entry, and
 * debits nothing; it returns the first purchase with a Replayed status. Same player,
 * same draw, SAME NUMBER, DIFFERENT client key => a genuinely different purchase, which
 * is created normally. Repeating a number is a legitimate thing a player does; repeating
 * a REQUEST is not. Conflating the two would silently refuse real bets.
 *
 * A key that is reused with a DIFFERENT payload is rejected outright rather than
 * replayed, because returning the first purchase for a different request would tell the
 * caller it bought something it did not ask for.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CLASS REFUSES TO TRUST
 * Wallet, balance, payout rate, potential payout and risk decision are all derived
 * server-side. BetPurchaseData strips those keys from the incoming payload and records
 * that it did, so the attempt is visible rather than silent. There is no parameter
 * anywhere in this phase that lets a caller supply any of them, and no flag that lets a
 * caller skip risk, skip the balance check or force a reservation.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CLASS DOES NOT DO
 * It does not settle. It determines no result, creates no payout, credits no prize and
 * closes no draw. Selling a bet and paying a bet are different phases and share no code
 * path here.
