/**
 * REAL (monetary) prize settlement of one published draw.
 *
 * THE MONEY TWIN OF DrawSettlementSimulationService
 * The simulation service proves that settlement logic is reproducible without
 * touching money; this service is the one that actually pays. It reuses the
 * same evaluation pipeline — published result → DrawResultData → per selection
 * SettlementSelectionResult — and then, inside ONE database transaction:
 *
 * 1. RE-VERIFIES the published result against winning_numbers row by row.
 * 2. WRITES each selection's settlement columns (is_winner, actual_payout,
 *    payout_multiplier) — the same three the simulation writes.
 * 3. CREATES one payouts row per winning BET and credits the winner's wallet
 *    through WalletService::credit(FinancialTransactionType::Payout), which
 *    posts the balanced double entry (prize expense ⇄ player liability) and
 *    moves the balance atomically.
 * 4. MARKS each bet Won/Lost, links winning bets to their payout via
 *    bets.payout_id, and stamps won_at.
 * 5. TRANSITIONS the draw to its settled state through the lifecycle service.
 * 6. RECORDS the run in audit_logs.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENCY CONTRACT
 * settle() on an already-settled draw computes nothing new: it re-reads the
 * stored settlement, verifies the stored selection columns still agree with
 * the evaluation of the published result (any drift is reported loudly, never
 * overwritten), and returns a SettlementResult with alreadySettled=true,
 * selectionsWritten=0, payoutsCreated=0. Payout references are deterministic
 * per (draw, bet), so even a crash-and-retry out-of-sequence cannot create a
 * second payout for the same bet; the wallet credit is additionally claimed
 * with a per-bet idempotency key, so a retried credit returns the original
 * financial transaction instead of double-crediting.
 *
 * CURRENCY
 * A draw's bets are expected to share one currency; a mixed-currency draw
 * produces a meaningless payout total and is refused rather than summed.
