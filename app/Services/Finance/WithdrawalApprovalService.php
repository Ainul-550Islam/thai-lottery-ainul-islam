/**
 * The review decision on a withdrawal, and the reservation of the funds.
 *
 * WHAT APPROVAL MEANS FINANCIALLY
 * -------------------------------
 * Approving a withdrawal RESERVES the amount: it moves from available to locked
 * inside the same wallet. The total balance does not change, no value leaves the
 * system and therefore no ledger entry is written yet. The money actually leaves
 * in WithdrawalCompletionService, which consumes the reservation and posts a
 * balanced double entry.
 *
 * Reserving at approval time is the point of the whole design: from this moment
 * the customer cannot spend the same money on a bet, and a second withdrawal
 * cannot be approved against it.
 *
 * TWO SIMULTANEOUS APPROVALS CANNOT RESERVE THE SAME FUNDS
 * Three barriers, in this order:
 *   1. The WALLET row is taken with `FOR UPDATE` before anything is read, so two
 *      approvals against one wallet are serialised by the database. The second one
 *      does not see a stale available balance - it waits, then reads the balance
 *      the first one left behind.
 *   2. The WITHDRAWAL row is then also taken with `FOR UPDATE`, so two approvals
 *      of the SAME request cannot both see status `pending`: the second sees
 *      `approved` and is refused as not approvable.
 *   3. WalletHoldService re-checks the available balance under that same wallet
 *      lock before it increases locked_balance, and the database CHECK constraint
 *      `locked_balance <= balance` is the final backstop.
 * So of two 80.00 approvals against 100.00 available, at most one succeeds and the
 * other fails with InsufficientBalanceException. The available balance can never
 * go negative.
 *
 * LOCK ORDER: WALLET -> FINANCIAL ENTITY -> LEDGER ACCOUNTS, always, in every
 * method here. This matches DepositService, WithdrawalService, both completion
 * services and the Phase 2.1 engine, so no pair of services can deadlock by
 * taking the same two locks in opposite orders.
 *
 * NO PAYMENT GATEWAY. Approving sends nothing anywhere. There is no provider call,
 * no webhook and no credential in this file.
 *
 * SCHEMA NOTE: `withdrawals` really does have a review trail - reviewed_by,
 * reviewed_at, approved_at, rejected_at, rejection_reason - so unlike deposits,
 * the decision is written to real indexed columns. There is still no
 * `approval_status` column, so WithdrawalApprovalStatus is only ever DERIVED from
 * those timestamps and is never persisted.
