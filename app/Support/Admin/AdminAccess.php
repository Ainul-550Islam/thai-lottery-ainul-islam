/**
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * The admin panel needs one answer to "may this operator do this?", and the project
 * arrived with two incompatible ones:
 *
 *   - config('permission.permissions') is a catalogue of human-readable phrases
 *     ('manage draws', 'view audit logs', ...) and RolePermissionSeeder grants exactly
 *     those to the five roles.
 *   - App\Policies\BasePolicy builds dot-prefixed abilities instead ('draw.view',
 *     'wallet.update'), which no seeder ever creates. Every such policy therefore
 *     returns false for everyone except super-admin, who passes through the
 *     Gate::before short-circuit in AuthServiceProvider.
 *
 * That mismatch is recorded as a finding in AUDIT-2026-08-31.md. It is deliberately NOT
 * "fixed" by renaming permissions here: the policies are covered by existing tests and
 * drive the API surface, so changing their vocabulary is a separate, breaking decision.
 *
 * Instead the panel authorizes against the seeded catalogue - the vocabulary the roles
 * actually carry - through this one class. Every Filament resource and page asks these
 * methods and nothing else, so the panel's authorization model is auditable in a single
 * file rather than spread across forty resource classes.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT DONE HERE
 * - No permission is created, granted or revoked. This class only reads.
 * - No role hierarchy is invented beyond the super-admin bypass Laravel already applies.
 * - Nothing here decides whether a domain operation is *legal* (a draw can only be
 *   closed from Open, a deposit can only be approved once). That stays in the domain
 *   services; this only decides who is allowed to ask.
