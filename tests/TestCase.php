/**
 * The project test case.
 *
 * WHY THIS CLASS NOW DOES SOMETHING
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The Phase 4.3 / 4.4 / 5.1 suites deliberately do NOT use RefreshDatabase:
 * a purchase asserts it is not already inside a transaction, so a suite-wide
 * wrapping transaction would break the very invariant it is testing. They use
 * DatabaseTruncation instead, which commits normally and truncates between
 * tests.
 *
 * DatabaseTruncation, however, only truncates - it never migrates. Every one of
 * those suites therefore assumed an externally prepared, already-migrated test
 * database, which is exactly how they were run during development
 * (`php artisan migrate` against MariaDB `thai_lottery_test`, with DB_* exported
 * in the shell). On a clean checkout, `php artisan test` used the phpunit.xml
 * defaults instead, hit an empty database, and reported ~211 errors of the form
 * "no such table: ledger_accounts" - failures with no relation to any business
 * rule.
 *
 * This override closes that gap in the only place that can see it: the schema is
 * prepared once per PHPUnit process, BEFORE the traits run, so truncation and
 * every fixture find the tables they expect.
 *
 * WHAT IT WILL NOT DO
 * It never drops or recreates a database, and it never runs against a database
 * whose name is not an explicitly allow-listed test name. `migrate` is
 * idempotent, so on the developer's already-migrated MariaDB test database this
 * is a no-op ("Nothing to migrate") and the historical workflow is unchanged.

     * A value read through Eloquent carries the model's `decimal:2` cast, so it always

     * comes back in the driver's own spelling: MySQL/MariaDB return the decimal(20,2)

     * formatting rather than the project's money handling, and eight settlement tests
     * failed on the very database phpunit.xml configures by default.
