        // WHAT THIS FIXES
        // Phases 1 to 5.1 built a complete draw lifecycle - open, close, await
        // result, publish, settle - and nothing invoked it. config('lottery') had
        // declared draws on the 1st and 16th at 15:00 and an auto-close five minutes
        // before the draw since Phase 1, and no code read either value. A draw
        // existed only if somebody inserted a row and moved only if somebody called
        // a service by hand. This schedule is what makes the declared calendar real.
        //
        // ONE TASK, NOT FIVE
        // lottery:tick runs the five steps in order inside one process, because the
        // order matters within a single minute: a draw provisioned at 14:54 must be
        // able to open, and a draw whose cut-off is 14:55 must close, in the same
        // tick. Five separate scheduled tasks would spread that across five minutes
        // and make the effective cut-off drift.
        //
        // WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT SCHEDULED
        // Result publication. The official numbers come from outside this system and
        // config('lottery.results.require_admin_confirmation') says a human confirms
        // them, so publication is the operator command lottery:publish-result and
        // appears nowhere in this file.
        //
        // THE KILL SWITCH IS HONOURED HERE TOO
        // With config('lottery.automation.enabled') false, NO task is registered at
        // all - not a task that returns early. The commands carry the same guard, so
        // a manual run is also refused unless it is forced.

                // both see the same draw as due. The lifecycle would refuse the
                // second transition anyway, but overlapping runs would fill the log

        // WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL, GIVEN THE CONTROLLERS ALREADY CATCH

        // and in a misconfigured environment, a stack trace.

        // WHAT IS NEVER IN THE RESPONSE
        // No stack trace, no file path, no line number, no SQL, no exception class name,
        // no wallet id, no balance. The mapper builds the body from a fixed set of codes
        // and a whitelist of safe context keys; it never forwards an exception message it
        // did not author. This holds regardless of APP_DEBUG - a production-shaped
        // response is what the API returns even when a developer has debug enabled
        // locally, because an API client should never receive a body whose shape depends
        // on a server setting.
